Certain third-party providers, including payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies governing the personal information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions. For such third-party providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by them. In particular, please note that certain third-party providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a jurisdiction outside Canada. As a result, your personal information may be transferred, stored, or processed outside Canada in connection with the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. If you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves a third-party provider, your personal information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction in which that third-party provider or its facilities are located, and contractual or other measures we may use to protect your personal information are subject to the legal requirements of the foreign jurisdictions where your personal information may be transferred, stored, or processed, including lawful requirements to disclose information to government authorities in those countries. For example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the United States, your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act. </p>
